This flag should be checked for articles that do not follow all of the accessibility guidelines for the site. You should also mark the specific content that has the accessibility problems using the associated Editorial block.

## Manual of Style

**TODO**: Figure out which piece of Manual of Style this relates to

## Work Items

Once the entirety of the article follows all accessibility guidelines you may remove this flag.

## Editorial Block

Be sure to mark which content has problems using the associated editorial block: [Template:Editorial/Accessibility](/Template:Editorial/Accessibility).

The editorial block should be as close to the content with problems as possible. If that's not possible (for example because the problem pieces are in a rigidly-structured part of the page), then put it in the Editorial Block at the top of the page.

If *most* of the content has problems, the editorial block should go in the Editorial Blocks section at the top of the page.
