## Background

HTML is probably the most central technology in the toolset that we work with every day. It is not glamourous, but it is essential to us all (ok, except for you rockstar script kiddies, but hey, what do you know? ;-) ) We have so far not started working on the HTML element property pages, but now seems like a good time.

HTML elements is a great topic to focus on for a Doc Sprint:

-   It is a relatively small number of articles.
-   All of the articles will have very similar structure, making it easy to track progress.
-   We already have a solid foundation and just need to layer on more/better content.
-   Having an island of strong content makes it easier for us to add other islands of content over time and build up the usefulness of the full site. Instead of boiling the ocean, we just need to boil a number of bathtubs sequentially.

It's always hard to prioritize, because it implicitly means that some things will be *de*prioritized. Hopefully the pros outweigh the negatives here.

## Milestone Goal

Documentation for all standards-track HTML elements is as comprehensive, correct, and helpful as--or better than--the current best sources for HTML elements.

## Project Plan

1.  Enumerate all HTML element articles to include in this milestone
2.  Pick one representative element and make its documentation the ideal model of HTML element documentation.
3.  Derive content guidelines for HTML element pages based on the documentation we created for the representative element
4.  Work on a handful of other representative articles to prove out the derived guidelines and iteratively improve them.
5.  Implement the necessary template changes to support the final content guidelines.
6.  Assign owners for each element, and track progress towards individual quality goals (e.g. Summary, examples, compatibility table, syntax)
7.  Review all articles to verify they meet our quality guidelines.

Not all these stages are done — in effect, you are the guinea pigs, and will be helping us to perfect our plan for doing this work! Keep giving us your feedback so we can make the operation as smooth as possible.

While we're working on articles, there are a few best practices to keep in mind: after you think your article is done, e-mail the list for others to take a look and review it. You should follow the guidelines as closely as possible. If you discover places where the guidelines should be changed or added to, propose them to the group along with the specific motivating examples.
