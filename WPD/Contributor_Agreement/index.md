This Copyright Assignment Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into between the participating entity contributing content to the WebPlatform.org site (“Contributor”), and the World Wide Web Consortium ("W3C"), represented through W3C Host MIT. This Agreement is effective as of the date content is submitted by Contributor (“Effective Date”).

Whereas, Contributor wishes to make available works created by Contributor and submitted for inclusion in the Web Platform Documentation Site (hereafter "Site"), collectively "Contributions."

Whereas W3C, in conjunction with the other Stewards, wishes to host that material on the Site with public licenses that invite public use, royalty-free, and to be able to re-license such material if the needs of the Web Platform community change,

Therefore, Contributor agrees to assign and hereby assigns copyright in its Contributions to W3C, for issuance to the public royalty-free under a public license such as those meeting the Open Source Initiative’s Open Source Definition (<http://opensource.org/docs/osd>) or Creative Commons (<http://creativecommons.org/licenses/>) terms.

Contributor asserts that it has all rights necessary to assign its Contributions, and that their publication on the Site will not infringe the rights of others.

Contributor retains a non-exclusive, world-wide, perpetual license to reproduce, distribute, modify, publicly display, publicly perform, and publicly digitally perform its Contributions.
