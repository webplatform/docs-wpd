## Reference section

Each tutorial article should contain a multi-faceted, useful reference section contaning a number of links:

-   Name of current article
-   "previous" and "next" links to take readers to the previous or next article in the series, or suggested "next steps", if the article isn't in an obvious series, or is at the end of a series.
-   Other "related links" to take the reader to articles that cover related topics or topics that were only touched upon in this article, in more detail.
-   Basic canonical articles: links to the definitive articles that cover the components of the current article. For example, in an article about creating buttons with CSS sprites, gradients, border-radius and box/text-shadow, you'd link to the basic articles that cover background, gradients, border-radius, box-shadow and text-shadow.
-   Links to the relevant specs covering these features. Do we need these here too?
-   Topic tags, which will link to other articles tagged with the same tag.

## Introduction

Brief introduction to the topic in hand: the problem we are solving, the technique we are demonstrating, the widget we are coding, or the API or module feature we are explaining.

## Article body

The tutorial is a step-by-step description of a task or use case. The reader should be guided from the beginning through to completion. The introduction should make a promise of what will be accomplished, and the summary should recap what they have learned.

The complete meat of the article. We probably need to work out some sort of guidance template for article body structure, but I don't think it should be too restricting. It can be more freeform than reference pages. The article body contains any code samples included in the article.

Theoretically, this will be the longest section of the tutorial, although it doesn't look it in this template.

## Summary

Summary saying what we learned, and any conclusions we can draw from the article.
