WPD uses [Piwik](http://piwik.org) to collect metrics. All of the metrics that are collected are available to all participating organizations and to members of the webplatform community.

Webplatform respects the privacy of our members and all those who visit this site and does everything in its power to keep strict privacy settings in metrics as well as other areas of interaction. With Piwik, webplatform:

-   Automatically makes visitors’ IP addresses anonymous.
-   Includes a web analytics opt-out feature for your client (using a simple iframe).
-   Deletes old visitors logs.
