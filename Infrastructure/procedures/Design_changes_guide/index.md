This document is about updating the site when we make changes that affects the visuals.

**General code changes are described in [WPD:Infrastructure/procedures/Deploying\_code\_changes](/WPD:Infrastructure/procedures/Deploying_code_changes)**

## Tips & Gotchas

-   When possible, you should strive to use colors already in our palette instead of inventing new ones, for consistency. You can find our color palette [here](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Design#Colors).
-   Single-color icons are (or should be) found in our symbol font, WPSymbols, under /srv/salt/code/docs/current/skins/webplatform/fonts. It’s generated through <http://icomoon.com/> . To edit it, you should upload WPSymbols.dev.svg (in the directory previously mentioned) to IcoMoon.
