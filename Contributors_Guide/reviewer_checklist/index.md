## Editing checklist

-   Are all fields filled out, especially:
    -   Standardization status
    -   Article Summary (does it stand on its own? does it reference related shorthand or longhand properties?)
    -   Top-Level Summary
    -   Values (each value has its own form field? definition elements, not example values?)
    -   Examples
        -   should at least have one exemplary of a common use case
        -   should link to the example on code.webplatform.org (no 3rd party code)
        -   no examples still living on MSDN site
        -   no duplicate "===Syntax===" section within Import Notes
        -   no "===Standards information===" (should be converted to our "Related specifications" form field)
        -   how do they look in various browsers (are there comments in the code @ code.webplatform.org re: versioning?)
        -   do the comments in the sample on code.webplatform.org point back to this property page?
        -   do the comments have an author, supported browsers, a short explanation?
    -   Notes section (if any, are they useful and not just left over from original content import)
    -   Related specifications (including link to any original spec, current recommendation, and editor's draft)
    -   Compatibility notes (up-to-date and not just left over from original content import)
    -   See also section
        -   Topic clusters: auto-generated list for see also section (see and [WPD:Topics](/WPD:Topics))
    -   Topics: general tagging for associating different pages & based on the topic category (see [WPD:Architecture/Topics](/WPD:Architecture/Topics) and [Property:Topics](/Property:Topics))
    -   External attribution (spot check sentences to ensure content is original)
-   Are sentences clear?
    -   Grammatically correct?
    -   Use present tense?
    -   Use first person or refer to user agent, such as the browser?
    -   Are sentences as short as possible?
    -   Is style maintained throughout page? Does it match style of related properties?
-   Check the Needs Review checkbox

## Technical review checklist

-   Is article summary technically accurate and clear?
-   Do values match the latest specification? Are the experimental features clearly marked?
-   Are values definition elements and not examples (see [[1]](http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/ReSpec.js/documentation.html#definitions) )?
-   Are examples accurate? Use best practices? Do they show common use cases?
-   Are notes & caveats sufficient?
-   Do links to other articles or resources pointing to examples that are best practices?
-   Could you add some fun, interesting, insightful notes, links, examples?
-   Uncheck the Needs Review checkbox
