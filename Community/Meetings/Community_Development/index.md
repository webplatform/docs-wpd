### Notes

Present: shepazu, julee, jswisher, scott\_rowe, millo (IRC only)

-   Doc sprints
    -   May 22nd NYC Doc Sprint has been postponed. Patrick is seeking a venue and a date.
    -   North Carolina sprint (Doug) is looking unlikely.
    -   No sprint for Portland/OSCON, as it's mostly *not* a webdev conference; but do a WPD Wednesday that week.
    -   Millo reports he has tentatively scheduled a sprint in Seattle for May 31st, in collaboration with U of Washington.
    -   Jay Meissner is working on setting up a sprint in Zurich, in conjunction with a conference, August 28th.
    -   Paul Verbeek (who attended the Berlin sprint) is organizing a sprint in conjunction with Fronteers in Amsterdam in October. Scott hopes to attend.
    -   ACTION: Scott to update Events page (already DONE)

-   University outreach
    -   Clarify what we're asking academics to do
    -   So far, just subscribe to a news list.
    -   Not focusing (yet) on programs or direct recruiting
    -   Reaching out to Tech Writing depts, like at UWash (not all U's have them)

-   Beta community efforts
    -   WPD Wednesday is to push towards beta content quality
    -   Reviewing is one of the 5 tasks for WPD Wed, along with writing basic facts, writing explanations, writing examples with explanations, and filling in links to related content.
    -   The CSS mailing list is a good place to recruit interested, knowledgeable people (not nec. CSS Working Group members, who are already over-burdened)
    -   Can do a broadcast appeal on the list; better if comes from someone not affiliated with W3C. ACTION: Julee to send message that Doug has drafted.
    -   Also approach list members 1-to-1: "Your post on X was great! Can you help write/edit/review WPD pages about X?" I.e., specific to that person, and their expertise, in response to something they did, asking for specific action. ACTION: Doug to ask Lea to keep an eye out for candidates; Julee is also on the list and can help.

### Agenda

-   Progress on university outreach.
    -   Spreadsheet created and sent to comm & recruiting TF members.
    -   We want funding to go to content contributors, per Alex.
-   Should we have a launch plan for Beta: who will create & lead it?
-   Should we have a "New & Notable" checklist: a mini-launch list for great new content or features. Something like:
    -   Get a couple of folks to look at it.
    -   Get a campaign id for piwik.
    -   Write a blog about it.
    -   Send it out in social media.
    -   Ask folks on the public list and IRC to re-tweet or whatever.
    -   Get stewards to point to it from their highly-juiced pages.
-   Doc Sprint North Carolina (?)
-   Doc Sprint Zurich, targeted for August 28: Call for Experts, who can support the event on-site?
-   NYC Doc Sprint update
    -   Patrick D'Souza working with venues to host the event before he starts promoting the event <http://wpd-nyc.eventbrite.com/>
    -   One of the organizers of Patrick's meetup has backed out because of some personal reasons so he's working with another organizer Matt Mapplebeck to identify venues and promote it. Working with About.com to get them to host the event (tentative). Emails have been sent out to other potential venues and meetup organizers and I'm waiting for their response this week
    -   Appnexus is unable to host the event as they are hosting some other events during that week.

##### University outreach
