## Surveys

We regularly poll our contributors and users to learn how we can improve the site, the doc sprints, and anything else the community needs us to improve.

Below are the surveys and responses we've received.

### Doc sprint surveys

These surveys are designed to learn how to improve the doc sprints.

#### San Francisco, April 3, 2013

See the [Survey Results](http://goo.gl/CEs8y)! Thanks to all who responded!

#### Berlin, Feb. 8 & 9, 2013

Survey [Results](/WPD:Community/Survey/Doc_Sprint/Berlin_2-2013).

### General surveys

These are surveys that we run independently of doc sprints. Some never close.

### Verbatims

We also track raw comments from various sources [here](/WPD:Community/Survey/Verbatims).
