### Doug May's brain dump

Points raised in this section need to be edited and incorporated into the above heading topics or have headings created for them.

-   Communications Plan -- Julee to add item (much already listed below falls under this, so the overarching topic has been inserted above)
    -   Our immediate opportunity to shape the conversation, and make major progress
    -   CSS Properties project
        -   Review/confront current status and definition of done
        -   Create and communicate a compelling vision of what it will mean to us as an industry and as an entrepreneurial community to have this as a resource
        -   Identify what it will take to get from here to promotably complete and usable
            -   Magnitude of the task(s) by area
            -   Design and roll out formal review and vetting
            -   Scale up examples and testing as needed to make it whole
            -   Key participants and roles needed to drive quality and social validation
            -   Promotional campaign (say it, do it, dance!)
            -   Be the game changer we have been nominated as
    -   Getting Started user experience design and usability
        -   Easy self-identification by skill, focus, stack level
        -   Clear instructions to get set up and get started
        -   Clear lists to pull from for the well-established roles and tasks
        -   Clear and constructive place to go if you're not clear on what to do
        -   Pick short-term (event-centric?) areas of focus to upgrade the overall system
            -   hint -- CSS properties completion and community review flow
        -   Simple metrics, gamification, promotion, results capture
        -   Open ears -- explicitly operate in learning mode; elicit feedback and overtly use it
    -   Survey
        -   Single instrument at checkin to orient new users, remove initial roadblocks, guide them in getting started, and collect feedback in the process (how long does wifi plus registration, IRC/dashboard connect, self-identification, and initial task training take?)
        -   Open-ended follow-up to gather stats but more importantly to hear what they have to say (what's in your way of making a bit of a difference on this every week?)
    -   Getting to steady state ("completion"}
        -   What is our overall definition of done?
        -   How much community participation will it take?
        -   What infrastructure will be needed to enable that?
        -   After ramp-up, what will it take ongoingly to maintain our status as the de-facto standard and go-to reference?
    -   Site architecture (especially the DOM apis)
    -   Dashboard
        -   Start to invest in the perception of continuity and sustainability of both the effort and the results
    -   Tech talks?
        -   Compete with Html5DevConf training day
        -   Snag experts while they're in town
        -   Exploit the fact that we already have great people, a great venue, and great food, and get some great learning done, in addition to some great work (embellish the fundamental service effort with some topnotch education and exchange of ideas -- the topics don't have to be dead center on the project, but bonus points for any who pull that off, too)
        -   Special task team end-of-day debriefs and reports (here's the site design upgrade from this sprint; here's what we did to flesh out the content review process)
